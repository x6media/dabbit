What is dabbit

dabbit is my attempt at building a simplified, cross-platform IRC client. My goals are to make the interface simple to use (NO clutter), prevent the need to constantly reconfigure when you jump to another machine or a new machine, allow ease of use with BNCs, and make IRC easy to use and fun to look at.

Roadmap

What needs to be done:

Base library
    Parse input and make calls to methods
Each Client UI
    Windows Desktop App \
                         | These can share an interface
    Windows Modern App  /
    Windows Phone 8 App
    Linux (GTK + Terminal to replace irssi) 
    Mac OSX
    Android App
    iOS App (Tablet and phone will share similiar interfaces)
    Web HTML App
A Socket Server
    The socket server will keep connections open for clients and forward connections on browsers that don't have native TCP sockets. Think mibbit for desktops

The HTML interface will need a javascript translation in the future so I can port it as a chrome app and use the native TCP sockets. It's being written in C# right now so I can take advantage of Xamarin/Mono.

The Configuration file will be downloaded via Skydrive/Google Drive/Local Sync option which a user will login with. This way you as a user will have the freedom to know where your config file is going.

Scripting Support

dabbit will eventually support scripting, however I don't know what language to use for scripting. If you have suggestions for a scripting language parser that preferrably already exists in C#.NET, let me know via admin@dabb.it

Thanks for checking out dabbit!
